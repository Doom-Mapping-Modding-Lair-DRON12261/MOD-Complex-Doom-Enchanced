[EN]
(+) Full refactoring of the project
(+) Russian localization (including zandronum)
(+) Changed the working of quick mines, grenades, and kicks - now they work with 
	Any weapon, without the need to write a separate code for each weapon for 
	quick action.
(-) Because of the innovation above, the unique animations for throwing a 
	mine/grenade or kick under each weapon are gone (at least until I figure out 
	how to implement them in conjunction with that standalone QuickAction system)
(+)	Now the grenade flies exactly in the crosshairs
(+) Mines no longer explode on each other
(+)	Mines no longer bounce off of actors
(+) Mines now track their target much more steadily
(+)	An upgrade for mines appeared: Stunning mines
(+)	The animation of the first revolver pickup can now be skipped
(+) The shotgun upgrade animation can now be skipped
(+) The upgrade animation for the Assault Shotgun can now be skipped

[RU]
(+) Полный рефакторинг проекта
(+) Русская локализация (включая zandronum)
(+) Изменен принцип работы быстрых мины, гранаты, пинка - теперь они работают с 
	любым оружием, без необходимости отдельного прописывания кода под каждое 
	оружие для быстрых действий
(-) Изза новвоведения выше пропали уникальные анимации для броска мины/гранаты 
	или пинка под каждое оружие (по крайней мере до тех пор, пока я не придумаю,
	как их реализовать совместно с той системой автономного QuickAction)
(+)	Граната теперь летит точно в прицел
(+) Мины больше не взрываются друг об друга
(+)	Мины теперь не отлетают от акторов
(+) Мины теперь гораздо стабильнее отслеживают свою цель
(+)	Появился апгрейд для мин: стан-мины
(+)	Анимация первого подбора револьвера теперь пропускаема
(+) Анимация применения апгрейда для дробовика теперь пропускаема
(+) Анимация применения апгрейда для штурмового дробовика теперь пропускаема

(-) Removed replacement for commander kin.
(+) Added cvar Pistol Start Bonus(cd_pistolstartbonus) - at the start in pistol 
	start mode, the player will also have 100 green armor, 3 ammo satchels and 
	a certain number (set by cvar below) weapon upgrade boxes.
(+) Added cvar Pistol Start Bonus Upgrade Boxes Count(cd_pistolstartwubcount) - 
	number of weapon upgrade boxes spawning in pistol start bonus mode.
(+) The system of weapon upgrade boxes has been reworked - now you can choose 
	one of three modes through cvar Weapon Upgrades Style(cd_weaponupgradesstyle):
	1) Old - A random upgrade just falls out of the box;
	2) Checking the player's weapons - Only the weapons that the player has are 
	dropped from the box.
	3) Portable upgrades - A random upgrade just drops out of the box, but now 
	it is a portable active inventory item.
(+)	Also, now all gameplay cvars are saved in the config (I'm tired of re-plugging 
	them after each restart).
	
[RU]
(-) Убран заменитель для командер кина.
(+) Добавлен квар Pistol Start Bonus(cd_pistolstartbonus) - на старте в режиме 
	pistol start у игрока также будет 100 зеленой брони, 3 сумки с патронами и 
	определенное кол-во(задается кваром ниже) ящиков улучшения оружия.
(+) Добавлен квар Pistol Start Bonus Upgrade Boxes Count(cd_pistolstartwubcount) - 
	количество спавнящихся ящиков улучшения оружия в режиме pistol start bonus.
(+) Переработана система ящиков улучшения оружия - теперь через квар Weapon 
	Upgrades Style(cd_weaponupgradesstyle) можно выбрать один из трех режимов:
	1) Старый - Из ящика просто выпадает рандомный апгрейд;
	2) Проверка оружия игрока - Из ящика выпадают улучшения только на те оружия, 
	которые есть у игрока.
	3) Переносные улучшения - Из ящика просто выпадает рандомный апгрейд, но теперь 
	это переносимый активный предмет инвенторя.
(+) Также теперь все геймплейные квары сохраняются в конфиг (мне надоело их после 
	каждого перезапуска перевтыкать).

//====================
// Changes from V27b2
//====================

(+) Fixed an oversight on the SSG & QSG inspects. The animations couldnt be
	cancelled with altfire, now they can.
(+) Improved the QSG reload animations a bit more by adding some extra frames,
	its a little bit less clunky now.
(+) Tweaked Railgun zombie, at longer ranges it takes him longer to "aim".
(+) Changed the player marine Rocket Launcher skin sprites.
(+) Players can now use the Reload key. Altfire still works as before so this
	change is optional. Again, this was requested for some time.
(+) Players can now replace their armor with better armor. Before, when you were
	holding say, 250 green armor, you couldnt pick up blue armor. Now you can.
	This goes the same for green armor and if you are carrying 100+ starting
	vest armor or even no armor (armor bonuses only) at all.
(+) Tweaked Armor.SavePercent on the three major armor types, buffed them
	slightly.
(+) Added another CVAR, players can now toggle the weapon fire screen shake
	effect by using "cd_disablescreenshake". 0 is default, shaking on and 1
	disables it. It can be toggled in the Mod Setup menu or through console with
	the command.
(+) Players can now individually toggle the Effects Throttle during online play
	instead of it being a forced serverside setting. Note to offline players, set
	the global setting to offline in the Mod Setup menu if you want to use Effects
	Throttling.
(+) Added a CVAR to disable the Marauder spawning on zombies, "cd_nomarauder".
	By default this is off so he will spawn as intended.
(+) Added yet another CVAR, "cd_keeppistol". When enabled this allows players to
	keep their Pistol when the Revolver upgrade is taken. Also, the Revolver is
	its own weapon actor now instead of being integrated in the Pistol decorate.
(+) Player crouch sprites now work.
(+) Changed Weapon Upgrade Box a bit, you now have to actually press use to open
	them. Made some new sprites for it too and it has a looping sound so its
	easier to find amongst corpses.
(+) Upgrades now have messages appear, telling players what weapons are needed
	for whatever upgrade they touch also if they already own an upgrade.
(+) Fixed ammo items moving around after they are picked up and respawn. However,
	for this to work the item respawn DMFLAG MUST be enabled on whatever port you
	are using, where as before it was not needed. Enable the item respawn DMFLAG
	through the port and have the mods "cd_ammorespawn" CVAR set to 1.
(+) Fixed the Radsuit moving around after it respawns.
(+) Very slightly reduced the Terminator Minigun heat gain during firing.
(+) Replaced the placeholder Quick Hands perk sprites. Also, the perk is now
	known as Adrenaline. Gives the same effect (increased weapon switch speed),
	I just renamed it to something more fitting.
(+) Added a new perk, Scavenger. It allows players to get a bit more ammo from
	all non-dropped ammo pickups. This doesnt include Grenade, Mine or Demon
	ammo, though I can change this at any time. Also, both Backpacks are not
	affected by this either.
(+) Added another new perk, Toughness. Once grabbed it will give 10% resistance
	to all damage taken.
(+) Added yet another new perk, Restoration. It allows players to gain a little
	extra health from Stimpacks, Medkits and Health Bonuses.
(+) The way perks are gained is either a Annihilator or a Demolisher (tier 1
	bosses) will drop a Perk Globe with 50% chance. The Globe is breakable by
	damaging it and the perk it drops depends on which perk is shown when the
	Globe is broken.
(+) Perk indicators now show up on both HUDs when they are taken.
(+) Added one last perk, Frenzy. When held it allows players to deal 10% extra
	damage.
(+) Fixed a multitude of minior issues and oversights thanks to WaTaKiD testing
	stuff.

//====================
// Changes from V27b1
//====================

(+) Sped up BFG reload some more, it was still too slow.
(+) Fixed player BFG10K projectile not using models when ThruPlayers CVAR was 
	enabled.
(+) Fixed an issue with the Plasma Rifle. After reloading or randomly when you
	first fired the weapon online it would either desync and not use ammo despite
	visually firing or fire normally but use ammo from both pools (the cell loaded
	in the weapon and the main cell ammo stock).
(+) Slightly nerfed the Hellfire Revenant once again, thing was still way too
	strong. Both comet and lingering fire damage lowered.
(+) Hellfire Revenant comets no longer weave.
(+) Buffed the DTech Fiend. I gave it a flame dash attack. Whenever its target
	reaches a certain range, it will run in place and then do a fast charge 
	towards the player its on and standing the way of it will do monstrous damage.
	It will also track the player but it can be easily baited to miss or knocked
	out of it via pain stating. Also when it becomes enraged it will fire a burst
	of DT mid lunge making running away from it slightly more dangerous. Buffed
	its rate of fire on the DTR attack.
(+) Fixed an oversight on the DTFiend, it healed less than the Spectre version.
(+) All floorhugger attacks (Pyro/Bruiser Demon fire etc) no longer go over tall
    walls or down high drops, instead they are only player step height.
(+) Fixed a duplicate frame on the Forgotten One sprites and brightmaps.
(+) Fixed a duplicate sprite name on the Black and Blue large blood pools.
(+) Slightly sped up weapon empty states, especially the BFGs. Basically makes
	reloading overall a bit less of an annoyance.
(+) Tried once again to fix the Caco/Pain type deaths bug where they will float
	on actors mid death instead of falling to the floor and splatting. Seems to
	be fixed now but I thought this last time and it still happened.
(+) Tagged all monsters, this should improve some addon support.
(+) Changed how weapon upgrades are dropped. Instead of monsters dropping specific
	weapon upgrades, they now drop a box that when touched will open and throw out
	a random chance upgrade for any weapon.
(+) Bomb Elemental now randomly drops the weapon upgrade box.
(+) Terminator also randomly drops the upgrade box.
(+) Terminator now has a high chance to drop the Railgun too.
(+) Buffed grenade and mine throwing speed.
(+) Fixed an issue with mines. Added SKYEXPLODE flag, mapsets that use skybox floors
	(Ancient Aliens is an example) caused mines to be wasted as they would just
	disappear.
(+) Fixed a bug with the Railgun. If you tossed either a grenade or a mine while
	the weapon was loaded it would jump to its empty state despite having ammo
	loaded.
(+) Replaced the placeholder weapon upgrade pickup sprites to more fitting things.
(+) Overhauled the lazy Handgun upgrade. You now get a Revolver which replaces
	the stock handgun once the upgrade is picked up. It has a slower RoF but it
	is much stronger, more accurate and penetrates enemies.
(+) Added visual indicators on both statbar and fullscreen HUDs for when weapons
	are upgraded.
(+) Revamped the Rocket Launcher upgrade. The multi rocket burst now seeks targets
	on screen. Also the weapon gains a visual change on itself.
(+) Fixed a bug with the RL upgrade. When multi rockets were cycled and the map
	was changed through normal means of an exit, the cycled rockets didnt exist
	anymore and the weapon would re-cycle on spawn in the very next map.
(+) Buffed the Plasma Rifle overcharge upgrade. Projectile speed and accuracy 
	increased, and slightly buffed the cooldown time.
(+) Buffed the Summoner. Gains more HP gain from "draining", also gave it back
	the ability to summon Arch Vile types.
(+) Fixed a bug with the Summoner. It would randomly die whenever one of its
	summons died.
(+) Red Armor can now be fully "repaired" to 250 with regluar armor shards and 
	inventory items.
(+) Revamped the Minigun upgrade. Once the lightweight barrel upgrade is grabbed,
	the weapon visually changes appearance, gains a rate of fire, damage and
	accuracy boost along with the manual spinning. Also, I gave it a new firing
	sound to further differentiate the two.
(+) Changed how effects toggle works. Added new CVAR "cd_effectsthrottle" with 
	three different modes. 0 is default, full normal effects will be shown. 1 
	is reduced, as it is implied, all effects are reduced. 2 is vanilla mode, 
	almost all effects will not be shown. Simply toggle it from the Mod Setup
	menu from the ESC main menu or alternatively players can do it via console
	with "cd_effectsthrottle 0/1/2". This means that Console Command has been 
	removed as this has been requested for quite some time now. This also means 
	the old vanilla mode CVAR/toggle option no longer exists.
(+) Changed how specific effects spawn. For example, normally if you gibbed a 
	zombie around a corner, no gibs or blood would spawn. Now it is also checked
	via range, so full effects (as long as Vanilla mode throttle isnt enabled)
	will spawn if players are within range, despite being out of sight when the
	zombie is gibbed. This also applies to other effects.
(+) Tweaked Devil Imp. Gave it a spread attack that it will do when close enough
	similar to the Void Imp. Also buffed its tracer, it will no longer stop
	tracking when dodged. Slightly nerfed the chargeball damage as it was too way
	too high. I felt like it was lacking for a 3rd tier spawn.
(+) Nerfed Famine tracer damage but increased projectile speed and the chance 
	that it will seek.
(+) Phase Imp buffed. Charged ball now seeks targets but stops after successfully
	dodging it, also made it weave so it has a better chance of hitting players
	with the shocks it emits when near it. I gave it a spread ball attack that 
	it will do randomly when close enough, and it will cast lightning at another
	set range that will do big damage to unsuspecting players. Like the Devil Imp,
	felt it lacking for what tier spawn it is.
(+) Gave the Magma Fiend a 3 ball spread attack as well as a seeker, it also has
	a chance to combo into the flame breath after a lunge attack. Felt it was too
	weak for a 3rd tier spawn.
(+) Changed the Poison Elemental seeker projectiles to match that of the Defiler.
	It will spit out two homing Poison Souls that cannot be shot but instead act
	like normal projectiles, they will leave poison gas in their trail. I also
	buffed the breath attack, it lasts longer.
(+) Cyber Knight got its Assault Shotgun attack back, it will also randomly drop
	the weapon with a reasonable chance.
(+) Added a new item, the Megapack. It has a chance of randomly spawning on the
	backpack. It gives a larger chunk of ammo, of all types over the regular BP.
(+) Slight changes to both HUDs. Moved the powerup timers to the upper left on the
	fullscreen HUD, this should prevent any issues on lower aspect ratios. And I
	moved the inventory bar to the bottom on the statbar.
(+) Fixed an oversight on the BFG zombie drop. Players couldnt pick it up cause
	I set both ammo types to give 0.
(+) Fixed a bug with the Rocket Launcher. If the weapon had ammo loaded and you
	had say 1 rocket ammo left in the main pool, the reload would give a max 7
	ammo loaded even though you didnt have enough for it.
(+) Fixed the Mancubus type spread patterns so they can be consistently dodged
	at medium to closeish range instead of being almost totally random.
(+) Fixed looping sounds on monsters that have them (Hellfire Revenent etc).
	Instead of the fire effect spawners playing the sounds each time they are
	spawned (a lot), the sounds are played on loop on the monsters themselves as
	soon as they spawn.
(+) Buffed the Barbatos. It will now fire 12 comets per salvo instead of 8. Its
	gas lingers and does more damage. Gave it a "shotgun" comet attack, fires
	off a cluster of small, fast moving projectiles three times. Gave it a fat
	bomb attack that does massive direct damage and fills the area it explodes 
	in with gas, basically a mini nuke. Also, when it takes pain it will randomly,
	aggressively charge forward and attack.
(+) Buffed the Hell Duke. The rage spike AoE deals more damage, covers a wider
	area and comes in more gradually. The Duke can be damaged during it but will
	take no pain. The attack will only trigger if within a certain range. Also
	it uses stronger projectiles for its common attacks and can combo into single
	comet spam. Slightly buffed its movement speed.
(+) Removed the invulnerable state from the Hell Duke, instead gave it no pain
	during its heal.
(+) Buffed the Bomb Elemental. Its death is more dangerous now as it leaves
	lingering fire. Gave it a three seeker burst instead of just the one. When it
	rages and suicide rushes, it now tracks more aggressively.
(+) Messed around with mines a bit, kinda got them to a point where they will not
	blow up in your own face when tossing them from a short distance right up
	against walls/doors. They will still explode when players attempt to stack
	them, this is intentional as it can be very easily abused.
(+) Added the Shotgun upgrade. The weapon gains a box magazine that holds more
	shells and the cocking animation changes, it is now cocked from the hip which
	increases its rate of fire. Also the weapon fires off a bunch of bouncing
	shrapnel, 4 shards per shot. Gave it a new firing sound too.
(+) Buffed the Assault Rifle upgrade. It now uses incendiary grenades and I
	increased the projectile speed.
(+) Made a couple more frames to the Assault Rifle underbarrel grenade upgrade
	reload animation.
(+) Tweaked the Assault Shotgun upgrade. On top of the drum magazine the it gains
	a foregrip, this allows the weapon to have a greater rate of fire but at the
	expense of accuracy. Kinda makes no sense but I gotta balance it somehow so
	it doesn't just crush the other three shotguns. Made some extra frames on the
	reload animation. Gave it a beefier firing sound once upgraded.
(+) Changed how weapon switching works again. Now whenever a brand new weapon is
	picked up and then equipped, a one time animation will play and then weapons
	will raise from an angle like they used to do before I made the select anims
	a few versions ago. Like, Doomguy constantly putting a magazine in the Pistol
	or cocking the Shotgun every time the weapon is selected, thats now gone. He
	will only "play" with his weapons during the first time they are selected,
	and the animation is fully cancelable right after raising via firing,
	grenade/mine throwing, quick melee or weapon switch. Also this is still WiP
	as theres so many to do. So far slots 1 through to 3 are done, including
	upgrades.
(+) Whenever upgrades are picked up, a one time animation will play on the weapon
	you grabbed the upgrade for and only when the weapon is already equipped or
	when you actually select the weapon. A weapon switch will not be forced on
	upgrade pickup, however, this animation cannot be cancelled. If it proves to
	be troublesome (like, during hordes or traps) I can always change this.
(+) Fixed the issue of keys not triggering traps or other events when grabbed in
	specific maps.
(+) Fixed a bug on the Assault Shotgun. If you tried to throw grenades or mines
	while having none during a reload, it would cause the weapon to go to the 
	pull charging handle animation everytime, even with ammo loaded in the weapon.
(+) Added the Marauder. He has a chance of spawning across all three zombie types.
	I gave him pretty much all his attacks except from his shield (invulnerable)
	gimmick. Having him spawn on zombie tiers I feel like giving him that also
	would be too much. I can always give him the ability later if I feel like it.
	He will drop the weapon upgrade box for zombie types on death with a
	reasonable chance. He is pretty much based on the Battlemode version currently.
(+) Weapon switching speed increased.
(+) Tweaked 4th Zombie tier spawn chances.
(+) Added the Hand Grenade upgrade, incendiary grenades.
(+) Tweaked firing animations on all weapons to make them smoother.
(+) Added the 4th tier Caco spawn, the Abaddon.
(+) Added slime death HUD mug state.
(+) Slightly buffed Zombie HPs.
(+) Buffed Zombie attack reaction times to match Vanilla.
(+) Buffed 4th tier Zombie strafe chance.
(+) Replaced the Doom64 Arachnotron sprites to the regular Doom style. It also
	doesnt fully behave like the D64 Arachno anymore either, keeps its dual
	projectiles but will constantly fire them in a stream like the vanilla Arach.
(+) Fixed an oversight when using the Demon Rune. If players had Berserk or
	Demonic Fury active, it would carry over into the demon form.
(+) Removed weapoon slot 8 (MP40 easter egg wep) indicator from the fullscreen HUD
	and moved numbers and selection indicator further to the right to make it more
	uniform with the ammo counters.
(+) Buffed Cacomental, it will now spew damaging shocks during its bite charge.
(+) Buffed the Terminator (monster) explosive chaingun rate of fire.
(+) Buffed the Baby & Cerebral Sentient explosive chaingun rate of fire.
(+) Buffed the Rictus kamikaze chance.
(+) Removed the recoil effect from the QSG and DTBFG10K.
(+) Changed weapon bobbing style.
(+) Pistol tap firing is more responsive.
(+) Fixed the Demonic Fury Berserk scream sound playing while dead.
(+) Rocket Zombie now uses the correct zombie sounds.
(+) Baby Demolisher now has a chance to drop the Minigun.
(+) Slightly nerfed the Grenade Launcher upgrade.
(+) Also slightly nerfed the Terminator demon form cluster grenade.
(+) Slightly nerfed the Watcher & Cacomental tracer turn aggressiveness.
(+) Fixed weapon firing sounds getting cutoff whenever the empty click sound
	played.
(+) Added Quake Ranger "skin" sounds.
(+) Added a nightmare font graphic for the "highest" difficulty choice.
(+) Added more brightmaps on weapons that are still missing them.
(+) Polished up some existing weapon brightmaps.
(+) Added a startup splash.
(+) Bunch of tweaks to random effects.
(+) Polished a bunch of existing sprites.
(+) Changed some existing sprites.
(+) Replaced some existing sounds.

Probably some other things I did that are not listed.

There is a known bug I havent managed to fix yet. Sometimes during online play
the F12 cam will bug out if youre spectating a player with an upgraded weapon,
the player will have a weapon upgraded and will work as intended on their side,
but the spectator cam will show that they have not. I assume Zandronum is causing
a desync issue from the amount of jump states I have in weapons, or I have messed
up somewhere and I am not seeing it. Either way, I will continue to play around
with it and hopefully come up with a solution in future updates.
